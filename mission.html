            <p>Studio ECSP is just another indie developer for now, but we have bigger goals than that in the future.</p>
            <p>Our mission statement is about the elimination of corporate dehumanization and greed as well as the union of independent videogame creators to slowly warp the videogame industry into one
            with way less greed and way more passion and art. We also want to dismantle the propaganda that circulates through gamers' minds about videogames and the industry.<br  />
            You might think that our goal is impossible or ridiculous, but no revolution was ever simple.</p>

            <h1>The elimination of corporative and capitalistic ideology in the videogame industry</h1>
            <p>Large corporations are a disease in the videogame industry. While they may be able to create great experiences and boost directors' reach, they ultimately do way more evil than good. <br  />
            Large corporations only see videogames as products to generate revenue from. If they weren't forced to, they wouldn't care about quality assurance and would produce complete and unfiltered garbage.
            The only thing currently holding back game corporations from fully transforming the videogame industry into a capitalistic wasteland is the currently low standards of consumers, which will
            continue to lower as corporations adapt them to slightly lower standards every time with excuses like "It is what it is" or "The economy is bad". Their goal is to monetize consumers further
            and further but slowly as to not upset them too much.<br  />
            A world where game corporations succesfully take over the videogame industry is a world where videogames are low-quality, extremely expensive products with predatory monetization and without a soul,
            which consumers with no standards whatsoever are more than happy to consume, not experience.</p>
            <p>Corporations are not your friends, even if they try to paint themselves as one.
            The only objective of a corporation is to grow and get rich by any means necessary, even if that means turning gamers into a cash slave. </p>
            <p>Any videogame produced with the goal of profit will never be greater than a videogame that is the product of passion and artistic vision. When your goal is profit, you cut corners as much
            as you can, which results in an experience with limited and missed potential. But when your goal is to create a piece of art, you create a product with limitless potential.<br  /></p>
            <p>Ultimately, what we want is to raise standards by quite a lot. We want gamers to stop consuming products devoid of love, which were designed with only profit in mind, and to start experiencing
            pieces full of love and care put into them.
            <br  />With everything said: This is not to say that every single videogame is a product of greed, but unfortunately the reach of 
            passion driven videogames is very limited compared to the filth of corporate products.</p>
